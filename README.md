# Medical-Insurance-Statistical-Analysis-Project-

Several factors influence how much one pays for insurance and this dataset gives a breakdown of some of the factors. The objective of this analysis is to explore the gender based differences in relation to medical cost insuarance.
I will be guided by the following questions;

1. Is there any significant difference in medical costs billed between genders?
2. Do beneficiaries with more dependents, categorized by gender, tend to have higher medical costs billed?
3. Is there a significant difference in medical costs billed between male and female smokers compared to male and female non-smokers?
4. Do male and female beneficiaries from certain regions tend to have higher medical costs billed compared to those from other regions?
5. Does gender have a significant impact on medical charges among individuals with different BMI categories, particularly focusing on overweight individuals (25.0 <= BMI < 30.0) and obese individuals (BMI >= 30)
